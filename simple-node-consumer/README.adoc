= NodeJS app

This terribly simple NodeJS App sends a request to `http://localhost:9876/formatgreeting` and prints in
on the response.

== Required modules

```
npm install request
```

== How to run it

=== Failing scenario

Run it without running stub runner boot and show that it will fail.

```
$ node app.js
```

you will get sth like this

```
ERROR - status [404]
```

=== Passing scenario

After installing `spring cloud cli`, run `spring cloud stubrunner` in `stub-runner-config`

and run the node application again

```
$ node app.js
```

this time you will get sth like this

```javascript
{"formattedGreeting":"Hi John Doe"}
```
